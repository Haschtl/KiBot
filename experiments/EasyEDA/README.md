# LCSC 3D Models

This is part of the easyeda2kicad code.
The whole code depends on pydantic and typing_extensions.
The dependencies didn't even install using pip on Debian 11.6.

This is the portion of the code needed to download the 3D model for an LCSC component code.
The generated WRL has colors, but not correct materials.

This is all related to the issue #380
